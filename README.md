All praise belongs to Allāh, Lord of all the worlds. May peace and blessings be

# Introduction

TODO

# Plan

To convert current macros in `pp.old` to GPP format.

# Honorifics

Honorific macros (should) include the following:

1. (سبحانه وتعالىٰ)
2. (صلى الله عليه وسلم)
3. (رضي الله عنه)
4. (رضي الله عنهما)
5. (رضي الله عنهم)
6. (رضي الله عنها)
7. (رضي الله عنهن)


Their Latin equivalents should be flexible;
they should be definable in different transliterations.

The GPP manual in the `reference` folder is from the GPP project.
It has been put there purely for convenience.
